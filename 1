    <h1><b>A poor essay written late at night</b></h1>
  My evening got away from me with a deadline for a manuscript, and this homework got postponed.  I'm not sure why I'm surprised, 
  but I'm not sure how to get the wdd.centre.edu site to load.  This means I have no real access to the syllabus, video, etc. 
  I made my <i>best</i> guess about which video it would be and used my extremely non-photographic memory to think of the syllabus
  I saw yesterday.  Here is my list that compares elements of the syllabus and the video:
    <d1>
      <p><dt><b>Collaboration</b></dt>
      <dd>Mayuko's expectation was that she'd be working alone, off on her own.  The reality was a collaboration with many different
      kinds of people.  The syllabus builds this in with the way that we are:
         <ul>
          <li>Working with a peer everyday</li>
          <li>Switching partners each day, for exposure to different kinds of people</li>
          <li>We move around the class, experiencing different locations</li>
        </ul>
       In this way, the collaboration is built into the classroom experience.</dd></p>
     <p><dt><b>Soft Skills</b></dt>
	 <dd>This is related to the above one.  Mayuko noted that soft skills were at least as important as technical skills.  Our classroom approach will 
	 at least provide some opportunity to work on that in informal ways.</dd></p>
	<p> <dt><b>I have no idea</b></dt>
	 <dd>I honestly cannot remember any assessments or other aspects of the syllabus.  So, this is all she wrote--or, at least all I wrote.</dd></p>
	 </d1>
	 As I wasn't able to grade this online, I'd be content with giving this a 2 or 3--whatever "minimal effort" is.  I will be ready to knock it out of the park
	 on Tuesday, and get that (apparently) elusive "8", particularly now that my manuscript is mostly done (it gets sent to the editor tonight (Thursday). 
	 <p>In conclusion, this was my essay.</p>
	 <p><b>THE END</b></p>
